<p class=MsoNormal>Employee : Corrine (Shop Assistant, in the role of clerk and
cleaning duties)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From : David O Neill (Manager &amp; Computer Technician)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Date : 11 / 5 / 2005</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Subject : Written Reprimand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is an official written reprimand for your continued
failure to complete your duties in the role of internet café assistant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You were previously counseled about litter and general
untidiness and lack of cleaning in the month of March. Since then there have
been numerous infractions, including failure to restock the toilets with paper
and the un- noticed pool of water/urine which has been cleaned personally on
one occasion and by Damien on another. Even though there is a minor leak in the
men’s sink this is no excuse to ignore the problem. In fact you should make
extra effort to make sure this doesn’t happen.   The importance of these duties
has a direct reflection on the customer experience in our café, topped off by
me getting lectured from Marcus after he received an anonymous tip from a
customer who had reported the problem to him. Over the last 2 weeks I’ve been
observing your attention to your duties and I find them unsatisfactory.  Every
day you come into work you pay more attention to chatting online and general
usage of pc’s. In one case to the extent that I’ve seen customers go un-
noticed while you work on your laptop at the designated stations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminding you, with this written reprimand, of the
importance of cleaning, in the areas on litter on the floor, work benches
rubbish removal and polishing, adequate floor brushing and if necessary floor
mopping. This includes the toilets.  Your failure to adequately complete your
duties puts extra burden on the other work members. It impairs the efficiency,
productivity, and morale of your work group.  I have also observed the other
staff members in this area and even though some of the duties could do with
more attention they make the effort to best carry out there duties.  For
instance when Emer comes in to do her shifts in the morning she immediately
goes around and cleans down the work tops. Monica tends to mop the floor even
though Damien and James mop the floor every night. As the saying goes a stitch
in time saves nine.  That’s means by doing bits here and there it doesn’t
become a big job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Further violations of the agreement we reached in the January,
when on day one I made it clear the importance of cleaning and since then oral
counseling may result in additional disciplinary action, including the
possibility of suspension without pay and/or dismissal from employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: I acknowledge receipt of this
written reprimand but not necessarily agreement with its content. I understand
that a copy of this written reprimand will be placed in my official personnel
file and that I have the right to prepare a letter of rebuttal to be attached
to the written reprimand.</p>
